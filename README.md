### Create Telegram Bot
1. Go to your telegram account, then search for `@botfather` and start a conversation with him.
2. Type `/newbot` to create a new Telegram Bot. Name your bot and define its username.
3. BotFather will display your Bot API Token. Copy it somewhere safe (don't worry you can still view it later).

### Retrieve your ChatID
1. Create the channel you want your Bot to post into.
2. Add your newly created Telegram bot into this channel.
3. Send a message with your user to the channel
4. Open Telegram `getUpdates` endpoint in your browser (https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_bot_token>/getUpdates), it will display JSON data
5. In the JSON data, retrieve the value of the key `id` under `chat`.

You're all set to modify the `env.yaml` file with your *Bot Token* and channel *ChatID*.
